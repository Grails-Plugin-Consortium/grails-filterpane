h3. Overriding Templates

To override a template simply create a {code}_filterpane{code} folder in your projects view directory.  Then copy the file you wish to override from the filterpane plugin's {code}_filterpane{code} directory.  You may create these files from scratch, but you will need to refer to the original template or taglib to see what params are being bound.

You can refer to the [demo project|https://github.com/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-filterpane-demo/tree/master/grails-app/views/_filterpane] to see an example of this in action.

{note}If you used a version since 2.0 and you customized templates in the filterpane folder, simply move them into _filterpane and everything should be good to go.{note}
