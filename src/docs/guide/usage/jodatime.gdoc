h4. Joda Time

Joda Time 1.4 is now included with the plugin.  May need to set ` legacyResolve true` in BuildConfig.groovy to inherit plugin dependencies.

The file `_dateControl.gsp` will attempt to render the joda taglib objects if using the appropriate types DateTime, LocalTime, LocalDate and Instance.  You may customize this if you wish via the installed template files in your project.


h5. DateTime Mapping & Support

For `DateTime` mapping support please see [Joda Time Docs|http://gpc.github.io/grails-joda-time/guide/persistence.html]

{note}
It is currently not possible to do certain types of criteria query with DateTime properties mapped using PersistentDateTimeWithZone (or any other multi-column Hibernate UserType). Aggregate functions (max, min, avg, count, etc.) in projections will not work on such properties and neither will the 'between' criterion.
